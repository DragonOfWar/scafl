# ScafL - Steam Card Afk Farm for Linux

ScafL (Steam Card Afk Farm for Linux) is a Linux application made with Python to idle Steam games for [Steam Trading Card](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/) drops.
This project was inspired by [Idle Master Extended](https://github.com/JonasNilson/idle_master_extended) and [Idle Master Python](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master_py).

ScafL features an interface built using Gtk.

This project was made specifically for the "Linux Gamers". Other operating systems may be suported in the future.

## Running the application

First, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your Linux machine. Check the instructions for your Linux distribution to install these dependencies.
To download the application, click the green "Code" button on the Github and click "Download ZIP".
After downloading the zip folder, extract it, and open the project's directory on a terminal (use `cd /path/to/scafl` command, or right-click the directory and click "open in terminal") and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
After that, run `python src/main.py`
